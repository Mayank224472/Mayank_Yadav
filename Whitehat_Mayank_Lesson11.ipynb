        "The Mind Reader game algorithm is built around the machine invented by Claude Shannon in 1953. He named it \"A Mind Reading Machine\". It predicts a player's next move based on his/her previous inputs.\n",
        "\n",
        "You can read about the machine by clicking on the following link provided in the **Activities** section under the title **A Mind Reader Machine - Claude E. Shannon**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Note:** *The algorithm is quite complicated to understand and to create. For all practical purposes, you just need to know how to apply the algorithm. It is completely all right if you do not understand how to create this algorithm.*\n",
        "\n",
        "In this algorithm, the computer looks for certain patterns in the player inputs (`Heads` or `Tails`) and tries to remember them. Furthermore, it assumes that the player will follow these patterns the next time if the same situation arises. \n",
        "\n",
        "The computer also contains an element of randomness. If an assumed pattern is not repeated at least twice by the player, the machine predicts `Heads` or `Tails` randomly.\n",
        "\n",
        "The types of patterns remembered, involve the outcome of two successive plays, i.e., whether or not the player won on those plays and whether the player changed their choice between the plays and after the plays. \n",
        "\n",
        "There are 8 possible situations and, for each situation, a player can do two things. These 8 situations are:\n",

        "1. The player **wins**, plays the **same** and **wins** again. The player then plays the same or plays differently.\n",
        "\n",

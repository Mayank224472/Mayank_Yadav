        "\n",
        "Also, we transformed both the `exo_train_df` and `exo_test_df` DataFrames by creating the `fast_fourier_transform()` function and then by applying it vertically on the DataFrame using the `apply()` function.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this class, we will learn how to synthesize (or manufacture) the artificial data points in a dataset by applying an oversampling technique. Generally, in classification problems such as this one, the data is highly imbalanced. \n",
        "\n",
        "In a highly imbalanced data, the number of data points for one class is very high compared to another class. The class having the most number of data points is called the **majority class** whereas the class having the least number of data points is called the **minority class**.\n",

The percentage of stars having a planet is $\\frac{37 \\times 100}{5087} = 0.727 $ % which is very low. Hence, the training dataset is highly imbalanced. \n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "An oversampling technique synthesizes the artificial data points for the minority class data to balance a highly imbalanced dataset. An oversampling technique is required to remove the bias in favour of the majority class in a dataset. \n",
        "\n",
        "The major problem with imbalanced data is that a prediction model will always be biased in favour of the majority class in making predictions. Recall that when we deployed the Random Forest Classifier model, it labelled every star in the test dataset as `1` even though the test dataset contains `5` stars belonging to class `2`.\n",
        "\n",
        "Hence, using an oversampling technique, we can artificially synthesize the minority class data in a training dataset so that both the classes have equal representation in the dataset.\n",

        "\n",

        "In this class, we will deploy a prediction model to predict which stars in the test dataset have a planet and which do not. The prediction model, through the training dataset, will learn the properties of a star that has a planet and also the properties of a star which does not have a planet. Once the model has learnt the required properties, it will look for these properties in the test dataset and according to the properties it sees, it will predict whether a star has a planet or not.\n",

        "There are many machine learning models or algorithms to do this kind of prediction. One of them is **Random Forest Classifier**. It is used to classify outcomes into classes (or labels) based on some features. For e.g., an animal that makes a 'Meow! Meow!' sound is classified (or labelled) as a cat, an animal that makes a 'Woof! Woof!' sound is classified as a dog, an animal which makes a hissing sound is classified as a snake etc.\n",
